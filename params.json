{"name":"Rhea","tagline":"Openstack Functional Test Framework.","body":"### Welcome to Openstack Rhea.\r\n\r\n### Introduction\r\n\r\nWhat's missing from Openstack QE / Dev groups? In one phrase “white box testing” or the ability to test individual\r\nfunctions and subcomponents, this will allow us to uncover small issues in the code base which can lead to larger\r\nproblems in the future. This is what is currently missing from many organizations, methods which allow engineers to\r\nperform micro-test or more focused test which insures a more robust product. Rhea looks to fill this gap and become\r\npart of the one major component most testing and development organizations have been needing. A low level functional\r\nproduct automation for quality engineers non-verse in python and a test library for those experienced to create new\r\nad-hoc functional test. This focus differentiates Rhea from Tempest and Rally as those two frameworks / testbeds\r\nare aimed at testing a completed solution, or what is better known as End to End scenarios test which is also known\r\nas “black box testing”, this approach is needed to insure that the customer experience is free of external service\r\nfawls, but it does not address issues where code path may not be executed do to the varying configurations which\r\nis possible with OpenStack.\r\n\r\nThis specification will describe a plan which hopes to address the functional testing and the immediate feedback the\r\nproduct development group is missing. The number one reason behind such an endeavour aside from a robust code base,\r\nis due in part to customer configurations and requirements, as the saying goes “there are a thousand ways to do something in linux”,\r\nwell now there are ten fold the options with Openstack which would never allow us to fully test all permutations that\r\nmay exist.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nToure Dunnon (@toure)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
